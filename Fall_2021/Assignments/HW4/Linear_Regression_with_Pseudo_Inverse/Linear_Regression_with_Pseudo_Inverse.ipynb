    "For example, people might want to find the relationship between lean body mass of human bodies and their muscle strength or analyze how the housing price changes by years to obtain an estimation of the price in the future. Most of the time, we might not be able to find such a linear equation that can be satisfied by all of those points, so finding a “closest” solution is the best we can do. We call these solution to be the least square solutions. How could we actually find such a **best-fitting curve**?\n",
