## Introduction

Welcome to the Linear Algebra course repository on GitHub! This repository is a central location for all the materials related to the course, including lecture notes, assignments, code samples, and other resources to help you learn the fundamental concepts of linear algebra.

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and linear functions, and it plays a key role in many areas of science, engineering, and computer science. Linear algebra is used in diverse fields, such as data science, machine learning, signal processing, and robotics. In this course, you will learn the basics of linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, determinants, systems of linear equations, and eigenvectors. You will also have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to real-world problems, such as image processing and data analysis.

The repository is organized into different folders, each containing resources related to a particular topic or aspect of linear algebra. You will find lecture notes, slides, and code samples in the "lectures" folder, while assignments and projects will be located in the "assignments" folder. There is also a "resources" folder that contains additional materials such as books, papers, and links to useful online resources.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for you throughout the course and beyond. Let's explore the fascinating world of linear algebra together!
